    - NOTE: Changed application_status to app_status, this only affects users of
      parse_record() or parse_record_body(). Former was unnecessarily verbose.
      Latter also matches the component name of FCGI_BeginRequestBody struct.
    - Added build_begin_request() and build_end_request()
      - added documentation and tests for these

0.05 2010-02-06
    - Net::FastCGI::Constant
      - Improved documentation
      - Added @FCGI_TYPE_NAME, @FCGI_ROLE_NAME and @FCGI_PROTOCOL_STATUS_NAME
        - Re-factored Net::FastCGI::Protocol to use these.
      - Renamed FCGI_MAX_LEN to FCGI_MAX_CONTENT_LEN
        - FCGI_MAX_LEN is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
    - Net::FastCGI::Protocol
      - Fixed parse_record() and parse_record_body() to properly detect malformed
        stream records.
        - Added tests for this.
      - Increased segment size in build_stream() from 8192 to 32760 to reflect modern
        socket buffers.
        - Updated tests
        - Documented segment size
      - Documented scalar return value of parse_header()
      - Minor documentation updates
